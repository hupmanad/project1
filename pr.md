What did you like about this website?
I liked the display of the game covers on the bottom on the screen. I also liked the intro paragraph
on the main page that directly states the point of the website. 

Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
Which has a better user experience (and why)?
One major difference is the location of navigation bars. Your other pages are accessed through images whereas mine
are located at the top. I like the hover effect on the images but I didn't initially recognize those images as anchors. 

Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
I think the organization of having a seperate game every page would make your site more maintainable than mine.
Mine pages are more focused on a timeline of a single game so I would have to add chronologically. 

Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
if not, suggest some specific improvements. Yes

Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
The main page didn't conform to a mobile screen. 

were semantically appropriate elements selected
is the CSS refactored to limit duplication? Yes

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
Maybe add some style for the anchors on the left side?
