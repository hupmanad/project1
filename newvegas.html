            <h2>New Vegas: A Series Revival</h2>
            <p>
                Fallout: New Vegas is a special game to me. Before I played it, I didn't think I liked RPGs all that much. Looking back on it, I couldn't have been more wrong. New Vegas came out in 2010,
                two years after Fallout 3. It follows the story of the player as the Courier, who is taken by a gang of theives while trying to make a delivery, shot in the head, and left for dead. They 
                don't die though, and instead are fixed up in a small town and eventually have to track down what happened to the package they were carrying. This leads to a quest where they must travel
                all across the wasteland, coming across a wide variety of people and factions as they decide the fate of the entire wasteland.

                As with Deus Ex, this is a very toned down version of the main plot. That's just because New Vegas has a ton of content in it, so even beginning to try to summarize it gets very confusing.
                The game is extremely fun though, especially in the aftermath of Fallout 3. Fallout 3 was made after Bethesda bought the Fallout IP from Interplay (creators of Fallout and Fallout 2), and
                while it wasn't a bad game, it had certain hiccups that made it unpalatable for a lot of returning fans: the game's writing wasn't all that interesting, the quests were often too simple,
                the combat was clunky and boring, and the game didn't feel like it really rewarded exploration. In the face of all these criticisms, it feels like Fallout: New Vegas bent over backwards to
                completely erase them all. Every location in the game is unique, and work was put in to make all of them feel deeply storied. The game world is unique because it doesn't feel like it begins
                and ends with the player, but that it has its own world that you're a part of. Games rarely manage to build worlds that feel so alive, but New Vegas nails it perfectly.

                Gameplay-wise, New Vegas is a big step up from Fallout 3. As much as I did like the previous title, it doesn't have anywhere close to the depth that New Vegas has. With many more types of
                enemies, weapons, and ammunition types, there's a lot more variety in combat. It is unlikely you'll be using the same thing for very long. On top of that, almost every quest in the game has
                different ways to approach solving it. This is a great touch, because it makes the player feel like the decisions they are making have real consequences. Instead of just being a simple romp,
                you get to make impactful decisions on what happens and how. This can have other big impacts later down the line, often changing the game's ending as well.

                I also have to mention the DLC, in particular Dead Money. One of the things I loved about the first Fallout was that it actually worked pretty well as a horror game on occasion. It wasn't just
                about post-nuclear fun, and was able to get the player to feel a bit unsettled. It didn't happen often in New Vegas, but it sure came up a lot in Dead Money. It manages to have this perfect
                survival-horror feeling that works so well. The player is always just managing to get by, always hunted by the almost-immortal ghost people. It feels so great exploring a dead location that has
                no equal anywhere in the Fallout series, except for maybe the military base from the first Fallout (shown below).

                In all, Fallout: New Vegas is an unforgettable game. It has an amazing atmosphere with very well written quests and characters. Even today, there's harsh debate among fans as to which faction you
                should support at the end of the game. If a game can generate that kind of discussion eleven years after it comes out, it has to be something very special. New Vegas manages all of that and more, 
                and I love every minute of it.
