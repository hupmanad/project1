            <h2>Team Fortress 2: The most fun you can have online</h2>
            <p>
                And that's no lie! TF2 is one of the best multiplayer games ever made. The player can select one of nine classes, like the explosive lobbing Demoman or the minigun-wielding Heavy. From
                there, you can select different weapons in each weapon slot to further customize your class, and then hop into one of many objective-based gamemodes. In game, the player will be on one
                of two teams, RED or BLU. Then it's just a matter of completing whatever objective you need to win. It sounds farily simple on paper, which I think is actually the game's biggest draw.
                It really isn't that complicated, you simply have an objective you need to accomplish. I like this because it doesn't try to muddy up the gameplay at all, you just have one thing you
                know you need to do.

            <p>
                As for the nine classes, I really appreciate the fact that they are all very diversified from each other. Each one has its own special feel and skillset that means it has an actual
                specific use. The Scout is a fast moving, lightweight class that deals high close range damage. The Soldier has a rocket launcher and a shotgun to take down targets at any range with 
                high blast damage. The pyro wields a flamethrower and does massive short range damage. The Engineer can create buildings like health dispensers and sentry guns to hold down areas. The
                Heavy uses a massive minigun to destroy any targets in range while having a huge amount of health. The Demoman can fire explosive grenades or use sticky bombs to hold areas and cut off
                choke points. The Medic can heal his allies and turn them temporarily invulnerable after healing enough. The Sniper carries a powerful rifle that can headshot enemies, doing huge damage.
                Finally, the Spy can turn invisible and disguise as enemies to slip behind enemy lines, carrying a knife that will instantly kill enemies upon a successful backstab.
            </p>
            <div class="imgbox">

            <p>
                What I really like about the nine classes is that they all have their strengths, but also notable weaknesses. The Heavy carries a massive, high-damage minigun, which sounds amazing. The
                downside is that the Heavy is the slowest moving class in the game and has very poor attacking range, meaning that he can be killed by Spies and Snipers very easily. The same goes for the
                Pyro. The Engineer can build powerful sentry guns, but is a weak fighter on his own so is often tethered to his buildings. The Solider can deal damage in large areas with his rocket launcher,
                but the long reload time can leave him open to counter attacks. Every class has good and bad situations to be in, so recognizing those situations when they arise and changing classes to
                compensate is all part of the fun.

                Above is part of what an average TF2 game would look like. A bunch of players defending a point while the enemy team tries to take it from them. From there, your class choice and playstyle 
                will impact how you go through each match. The upside is that it's all but certain you'll have a fun time. Every map plays differenly, with some being Capture the Flag, some are Payload,
                Control Points, so on and so on. The fact that there's such a variety means that no two matches will ever really feel the same. I am a huge fan of that, and it makes me feel like the games
                I play are all that more impactful.

                Overall, Team Fortress 2 is a hugely foundational game for me. It made me love multiplayer shooters, and showed me that multiplayer games did not have to be a super competitive field. You can
                have a good time playing in casual matches, experimenting with new loadouts and different classes. The game managed to have a level of fun that no other game has really been able to match, and
                I would love if there were either a sequel or spiritual successor to the game.
