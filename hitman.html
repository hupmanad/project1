            <h2>Hitman: Contracts: ???</h2>
            <p>
                The question marks might seem odd, but even I am a little surprised when I thought of Contracts. There are a lot of Hitman games, but more importantly, there are a lot of GOOD Hitman games.
                As a series, it really doesn't miss. So then why Contracts? Aren't there better Hitman titles? Well, yeah. I feel like most people would say that Hitman: Blood Money is a better game, and to
                be fair, it is a very very good game. But I chose contracts because, honestly, it just kind of nails the Hitman vibe I want to see in my games. Specifically, I kind of like more horror focus
                in games that aren't really meant to be horor. I know that is a little confusing, but let me explain. 
            </p>

                Games like Hitman aren't very bright or happy, which is the point. The world of assassination is a dark and scary place, which I think makes it an interesting setting for a game. In Contracts,
                you take on the role of Agent 47, a genetically engineered clone who works as, well, a hitman. The entire game is played through flashbacks as 47 is losing consciousness after being shot in a
                botched mission. There are eight levels in total, four of which are remakes of levels from Hitman: Codename 47 (the first game) and the other four being original levels. I really like this as an
                idea. Codename 47 was a great game, but is honestly a little dated. If you don't know what you're getting into, you're probably not gonna have a great time. Contracts makes a lot of gameplay
                improvements over the first two games, so these levels end up playing a lot better than they used to. I think this is a good way to hook in new players that didn't get the chance to play the
                original back in 2000.

            <p>
                As for aesthetics, I think that Contracts really nails it. The whole game has this very dark and gritty atmosphere that I just can't get enough of. I'm not really a huge blood and guts kind of
                person who thinks you need ultra violence to sell a game, but Contracts being a bit more violent helps the game find better footing and gets me more interested with what's in store. For example,
                the first level of the game takes place in an old slaughterhouse that has been renovated as a dance club, but still has a lot of nasty slaughterhouse things in it. I love this because you go from
                blending in with this party to sneaking into the back of the meat processing plant, and suddenly things are a lot more violent and tense. The game just makes such good use of creative places like
                this, and every level feels just as intense as the last.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game has some nice weather effects as well. I'm a sucker for some good rain in games, and Contracts uses it fairly often to set the mood for certain levels. Between that and the snowy levels
                that genuinely feel cold, and you have some very good levels for setting the mood. All of these end up showing why I picked Contracts over any other Hitman: the game just has a much better mood than
                the rest. Basically every other game gets a little too bright and fun, but Contracts keeps things dark and shadowy the whole time. It feels a lot darker and a lot more lonely throughout the entire
                game, which I think is the best feeling a game like this can cause. Loneliness for a game like this gives you a lot of time to admire little detailing in the game itself, plan your next moves, so
                on and so forth. No other Hitman game has really nailed that feeling for me, and I'm not sure they ever will.

                Really though, this entry could have just been for the whole Hitman series. They're as much puzzle games as they are stealth games, so I always have a good time trying to work through their levels.
                Each one brings something good and unique to the table, and it just ended up being that Contracts was the one I came through feeling best about. I like how the game always manages to take things one
                step further, always edging the boundary of 'too far'. It's hard for a game to be so dark and so entertaining, but Contracts manages just fine.
