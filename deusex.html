            <h2>Deus Ex: All Time Favorite</h2>
            <p>When I say favorite, I mean it. Deus Ex is my favorite game of all time, and it's not close. Coming out in 2000, you play as JC Denton, a nanomachine-augmented antiterrorist agent
                working for UNATCO, the United States Anti Terrorist Coalition. While it begins as a normal stealth-action game, it slowly begins to take darker turns: the people you're working
                for may not actually be the good guys, your government is committing their own acts of state-mandated terrorism on the citizens, and the entire global order is on the brink of collapse.

            </div>
            <p>That's an extremely barebones version of the plot, but there's so much detailing you really wouldn't want spoiled. The game manages to bring in a lot of well-known conspirary theories
                and turns them into an actual narrative that works very well, and the people living in the world react to everything exactly how you would expect real people to. I also love the idea
                of using popular conspirary theories in games, because I think it gives them an interesting set of options where they get to mimic real-world situations, but with that twist of insanity
                that makes them memorable. Take, for example, the above images. It shows the player and an allied agent facing off against augmented Men In Black as they fight their way through a run
                down New York City hotel. As crazy as it sounds, the game just rolls with it in a way that makes it believable.

            </div>
            <p>I think that, because of the age of the game's engine, some may look down upon the chunky graphics. I sharply disagree. I found Deus Ex's graphics to be really pleasing to look at.
                It has an incredible diversity of locations, from the streets of New York to French nightclubs and chateaus to markets in Hong Kong. Every area feels totally unique instead of just
                one big blob. Progression feels a lot more meaningful to me in games when I feel like I'm actually coming across something new, rather than just rehashing something I already saw.
                On top of that, I am an absolute sucker for reflective surfaces in games, and Deus Ex makes frequent use of mirrors and shiny floors. Detailing like that goes so far to make the
                world feel more real to me.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Finally, Deus Ex's music is just amazing. The game had several composers, and all of them played a role in creating an incredibly memorable soundtrack. The video above is one of my
                favorites, but there are a lot of good ones to choose from like Hong Kong and Area 51 (Which I forgot to mention, is also in the game). Good music is essential to setting the tone
                and mood of your game. Deus Ex manages to have varied and beautiful sounding music in every level. It is rarely repeated, so there's always something new to listen to.

            </div>
            <p>Overall, Deus Ex is, in my opinion, one of the greatest games ever made. It manages to have a perfect atmosphere, engaging writing, enternaining combat and level design, and so much
                more. While there have been other games released in the series later (Invisible War, Human Revolution, Mankind Divided), none of them can really hold a candle to Deus Ex. It is a
                game defined by its era, and I find it unlikely that there will ever be a game quite like it. I even liked it enough that I named my blog after UNATCO, the organization you work for
                in the game. That's an enduring legacy I will never forget.
